                A teary-eyed Smriti Singh accepted Kirti Chakra awarded posthumously to her husband,
                 Captain Anshuman Singh, who died in the line of duty in July 2023.We had a long conversation on July 18 and on July 19 we got to know he is no more," recalled Smriti Singh, the widow of late Captain Anshuman Singh, who was awarded the Kirti Chakra posthumously for displaying indomitable courage and giving ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.
        
                 President Droupadi Murmu, who is the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, conferred the Kirti Chakra, India's second-highest peacetime gallantry award, posthumously to Captain Singh</p>

            <p class="content">Ms Khedkar was using her private Audi - a luxury sedan - with a "Government of Maharashtra" sticker and a red-blue beacon in Pune. Even before joining as an assistant collector, she had demanded an official car with a VIP number plate, accommodation, an official chamber with adequate staff, and a constable. A trainee officer is not entitled to these privileges. 

                Reports suggest that her father, leveraging his position as a retired administrative officer, even pressured the District Collector's office to fulfill his daughter's demands. This influence extended to her workplace behaviour where she allegedly removed the nameplate of senior officer Ajay More in the Pune collector's office to use the space for herself. 
                
                These actions were seen as a misuse of power and resulted in her transfer from Pune to Washim. She will now be serving as a supernumerary assistant collector in the Washim district, where she will complete her training until July 30, 2025, according to an order issued by the Pune District Collector to the Chief Secretary. </p>

            <p class="content">Amid concerns over India's ties with Russia, a top US official on Thursday cautioned New Delhi that a "bet on Russia as a long-term, reliable partner is not a good bet" and Moscow would side with Beijing over New Delhi in case of a conflict between the two Asian giants.
                US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan made the remarks while replying to a question on MSNBC about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit to Moscow where he held extensive talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
                
                "We've made clear to every country in the world including India that a bet on Russia as a long-term, reliable partner is not a good bet," said Mr Sullivan, who was in India last month for a meeting with his counterpart Ajit Doval..</p>

            <p class="content">Exam paper leaks cause immense damage to the psychological state of India's younger generation in pursuit of a better, more progressive future.
                The NEET exam scandal has emerged as an enormous breach of trust and appears to have caused irreparable harm to the Modi government's social and political contract with its citizenry, particularly aspiring youth.
                
                The rhetorical pitch for an alternative development model in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 2014 electoral pitch, away from cycles of corruption, administrative incompetence and policy inertia, was supposed to offer hope and faith among India's young people in participating (and constructing) India's growth story. It has done quite the opposite</p>
